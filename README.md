# Project from "Building a programming language in an hour"

This is the project I made while doing the [Building a programming language in an hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkd3mZYOOvw) video.

You can run it, once you have Rust installed, by doing:

```
cargo run -- <name of source file>
```

And run tests with

```
cargo test
```
